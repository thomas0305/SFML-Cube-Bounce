# SFML-Cube-Bouncer
This is my first project with the use of SFML.

This is a simple program that just makes the cube bounce around, similar to the DVD logo one.
When it hits one of the walls, it reverts the velocity based on which wall it hit (either X or Y velocity).

To run this program, you need to setup the SFML library in Visual Studio, and then simply open the project and run it.
